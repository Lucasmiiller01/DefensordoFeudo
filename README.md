# DefensordoFeudo
A tower game Defenser whose goal is survive the maximum time was possible.

(Made in c# script and unity engine 4.6 plataform | it's unlikely that well enable in the less version or in unity 5)

TODO: 
	- Add a database comunication (the actual version has a primitive system, but the comunication still precarious)
	- Add the end of the game (death player).
	- Add a day and night transition system.
	- Add new maps (possibile a map in the moon, this would be so beautiful *)
